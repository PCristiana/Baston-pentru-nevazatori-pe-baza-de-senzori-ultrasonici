#Smart Cane for the Visually Impaired

This project is an accessible and practical solution designed to assist visually impaired individuals in detecting obstacles in their surroundings. Using an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, the cane measures the distance to nearby objects and reacts dynamically based on proximity.

To communicate information intuitively, the user receives feedback through vibrations generated by a 3V vibration motor and audio signals produced by a piezoelectric buzzer. Both vibration intensity and sound complexity increase as obstacles get closer, providing clear and effective guidance.

All components are controlled by an Arduino Uno R3 board programmed to manage the system logic. The device is powered by four AA batteries (6V), and the hardware is mounted on a PCB to ensure a secure and portable design.

Thanks to its simplicity and efficiency, this smart cane provides a solid foundation for future extensions such as GPS, Bluetooth connectivity, or mobile app integration, contributing to a safer and more independent environment for visually impaired users.
